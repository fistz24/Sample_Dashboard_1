Motivation
----------
This simple Sales Dashboard was built to help small businesses to track their performances.
I realized that we could only find complex dashboards that are applicable to corporate activities only, and no resources are available for small businesses.

## Dataset
All the data used are dummy data

## Files Explained
* The project assumes the business is located in two cities; Jakarta & Surabaya, Indonesia - This can be adjusted based on your needs by adding or removing the cities
* The project assumes the business as a cafe business, with drinks as the main products
* Total cups sold recorded in the Python file is the number of cups sold by the cafe
* Costs were classified into 3 categories:
    * Fixed Costs
    * Ingredients Costs 
    * Other Variable Costs
    * Marketing Costs
* Shall other types of costs need to be added, those can be added easily by following the format derived from the other cost categories
* The styling of the dashboard can be changed by changing the css files, which are located in the "asset" folder
* The definitions.py file is used to define number formatting

Here are some of the preview of the Dashboard
